# Origin design

I built this webpage from the design made by Creative Grenade as an afternoon task for myself. To see if I could do it and how much I could do before dinner.

**Time spent:** About 4/5 hours?

So this project went pretty well. I was going forward pretty well, not many hold ups at all. The flexbox layout worked out like a charm.
There are a few minor layout bugs, too much padding in places or not enough in others. I have no idea how I intend on doing the product layout and I just didn't attempt to do the product overlay because I was hungry.
